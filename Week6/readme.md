This weeks problem is to approximate the square root of a number
I vagely remember this and other methods in my undergrad courses so I had to researched

The method is to take an initial guess and then to plug the result of the first go of the formula into the formula again and to get nearer the actual result - the approximation depends on what we want it to be. On testing it was set to 1 but the completed script has set it much lower.

I found the formula through a google search..
